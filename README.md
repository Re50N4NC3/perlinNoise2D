Perlin noise showcase

Basic showcase of Perlin noise implementation, it allows to change the seed, octaves, and height of the output. However, it's only approximation, but a heuristic one. In this example it's used to generate natural looking terrain in discrete manner, infinite scroll is achieved thanks to the chunks generated on the go.
